### **Introduction**

This repository contains a diverse range of machine learning projects, from basic algorithms to more complex implementations. The code here covers various aspects of ML, including but not limited to:

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or an experienced practitioner seeking inspiration, you'll find something interesting here!

### **Feature Normalization Encoding**
- `Feature normalization`, also known as feature scaling, is the process of transforming numerical features to a common scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values.\
Common feature normalization methods include:
1. Min-Max Scaling
2. Standardization
3. Robust Scaling
- `Feature encoding` is the process of converting categorical variables into numerical format that can be used by machine learning algorithms.\
Common encoding methods include:
1. One-Hot Encoding
2. Label Encoding
